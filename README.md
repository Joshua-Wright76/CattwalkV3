# CattwalkV3
Newest version of the board game Cattwalk.

As of the postalpha version, Cattwalk is not a standalone executable. CattwalkV3C.py is the client side, and CattwalkV3S.py is the server side. When CattwalkV3S.py is run, the console will state that it is waiting for the client. When the client is run, it will prompt the user for an IP address, and will start communicating with the server once the address is given.

The rules for Cattwalk are listed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YizzxLIDjdhxS-v6xHXdIDQzvt9Ecwo46i-UPtq-rR4/edit?usp=sharing
This implementation of Cattwalk uses the "Warara" ruleset, though several rulesets may be allowed as options in future updates.
